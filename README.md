# Using Chatbots in Healthcare for Hypertension – Graduation Project

## 📚 Project Overview
This project explores the use of AI-driven chatbots to support hypertension self-management. It investigates physicians' perceptions of healthcare chatbots and develops a prototype chatbot designed to help patients manage hypertension through features like appointment scheduling, blood pressure tracking, and prescription refill requests.

## 🏥 Background
Hypertension is a major chronic disease worldwide, yet many patients struggle with self-management. Chatbots offer an innovative way to improve healthcare delivery by providing accessible, personalized support without the constraints of time, location, or staffing shortages.

Despite the potential, adoption among physicians remains limited. This project aims to bridge that gap by understanding medical professionals' needs and creating a chatbot aligned with their recommendations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Investigate physicians' views toward healthcare chatbots for hypertension management.
- Identify key features physicians find most valuable in a healthcare chatbot.
- Develop a prototype chatbot based on real-world physician feedback to assist patients with hypertension self-care.

## 🧪 Methodology
The project was conducted in two main stages:

1. **Cross-Sectional Study**  
   - Surveyed 59 physicians across Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using a validated questionnaire.
   - Analyzed physician perceptions, satisfaction, feature preferences, and prescription likelihood using SPSS.

2. **Chatbot Development**  
   - Built a prototype chatbot using the WotNot platform.  
   - Designed key functions based on survey results:
     - Appointment scheduling
     - Blood pressure tracking
     - Prescription refill requests
     - Access to educational content about hypertension
   - Created detailed flowcharts for user interaction pathways.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Survey Analysis:** SPSS
- **Chatbot Platform:** WotNot
- **Design:** Flowcharts and structured conversation mapping

## 📝 Key Results
- 62.7% of physicians indicated they are somewhat or very likely to prescribe chatbots to patients within five years.
- Physicians prioritized features like BP tracking, appointment scheduling, and medication refill systems.
- Physicians stressed the importance of user privacy, language support, and accuracy for real-world adoption.

## 🔮 Future Recommendations
- Expand chatbot capabilities to multiple languages (especially Arabic) to enhance accessibility.
- Incorporate patient perspectives in future studies to ensure usability from both provider and patient sides.
- Integrate chatbot systems with hospital record systems for greater continuity of care.
